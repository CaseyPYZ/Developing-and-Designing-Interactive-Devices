Submitting labs with GitHub: a 3-minute guide

This guide will walk you through creating a GitHub account, creating your "hub" repository for listing your labs, pulling the lab  and creating new a file for assignments in that homework.

#To create a GitHub account

If you already have a personal GitHub account, feel free to use that -- no need to create a new one for this course. If you don't have an account, create one:

Head over to GitHub.com.
Enter your choice of username, your school email address, and your choice of password.
Click the big green "Sign up for GitHub" button.
If prompted, choose the "free" plan.

#To fork your class "Hub" repository 

Visit the IDD Hub example repository and "fork" it into your GitHub account by clicking the "fork" link; it should look similar to this:


#To pull lab updates

For each lab, you'll need to make a pull request to get the new lab files into your hub. These are usually ready on Tuesday for the following Thursday.

To create a new file for an assignment

Click the "Create new file" button on your repository page:

New File

Note that you can also click the "Upload files" button instead to add images, movies, or other file times to your repository.

From *your* Interactive-Lab-Hub, go to "Pull Requests"
Then, paste your code into the "Edit new file" tab.

Finally, click the "Commit new file" button.

New file options

To edit the main repository README.md file, or if you later wish to make changes to your code, you can do so through github as well. First, find the file you'd like to change, and click on the file name:

File list

Then, click the "Edit this file" icon:

Edit file

Make your changes as in step 2 above.
